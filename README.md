# Extract to Act

An AI-assisted invoice-to-accounts-payable automation system: it takes an arbitrary invoice document, turns it into a structured record it can actually trust, and carries that record through a real business decision — validate, route to a human when warranted, approve, and post to a downstream ledger — with every step auditable and recoverable.

## Why this exists

Invoice processing is a mature automation domain — deterministic three-way matching already handles the majority of invoice volume in well-run AP departments without any AI involved. This project isn't trying to reinvent that. It's a deliberate demonstration of the part that's still genuinely hard: knowing when an AI extraction is trustworthy, what to do when it isn't, and never letting a probabilistic step make a deterministic financial decision on its own.

See [`docs/problem.md`](docs/problem.md) for the full business-problem writeup, including why this framing was chosen over alternatives like receipts, purchase orders, or claims.

## Status

**Phase 2 of 19 — Project Foundation & Tooling.** The application is an empty, runnable FastAPI skeleton — no business logic yet. See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the full phase roadmap and current progress.

## How the system works, briefly

An invoice arrives, gets read and structured, and is checked deterministically — does the math add up, have we seen this invoice before, do we recognize this vendor. If everything checks out with high confidence, it moves forward untouched. If anything is uncertain, it's queued for a person to review, side by side with the original document. Once validated and (if needed) approved, it becomes a real record in a downstream accounting system, with a full audit trail behind it.

## Tech stack (planned)

Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy + Alembic, Docker, a scheduled polling worker (no message queue), deployed on Render. Reasoning for each in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/). The extraction provider is intentionally undecided — see [`docs/extraction-strategy.md`](docs/extraction-strategy.md).

## Local setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The app is then available at `http://localhost:8000/health`. Nothing beyond a health check exists yet — see `PLAN.md`.

### Running tests / lint without Docker

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest        # Tier 1 + Tier 2 only, no real API calls — see docs/testing-strategy.md
ruff check .
```

### Pre-commit hooks (lint + secret scanning)

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Secrets

This is a public repository. No credentials of any kind are ever committed. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list of configuration variables the application will eventually need, and [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md) for the full repository-safety approach.
